CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
REPORT
The Standard Group PLC ("the Group or Company")
Board of Directors ("the Board") is steadfast in its belief
that good corporate governance creates shared value
by underpinning responsive thinking and protects
shareholder value by ensuring responsible behaviour
through effective leadership, enhanced accountability,
heightened transparency and a robust risk management.
The Board has embraced principles of good corporate
governance in steering the Group to effectively achieve
its mandate for sustainable growth in shareholder value
and to meet stakeholder expectations.

As a company listed in the Nairobi Securities Exchange,
we remain steadfast in complying with statutory and
regulatory requirements as outlined in the Constitution of
Kenya,2010, the Companies Act 2015, the Capital Markets
Authority's Code of Corporate Governance Practices for
Issuers of Securities to the Public, 2015 (the Code), the
Capital Markets (Securities) (Public Offers, Listing and
Disclosures), 2003 and other applicable laws in all areas
of the Company's operations. Besides complying with the
Code, the Board has committed to embed internal rules
of engagement to support corporate governance. These
internal guidelines are constituted in the Code of Conduct
and Ethics to which every Director and employee attests
their adherence.

This corporate governance statement provides necessary
information to enable stakeholders and investors evaluate
how the Company has applied the principles embedded in
the Code besides the self-assessment that the Company
is expected to complete on its level of compliance with the
Code and also outlining key corporate governance practices
and arrangements of the Group. The Group remains
committed to the standards of corporate governance and
business ethics which are essential to the delivery of long
term and sustainable stakeholder and shareholder value.
The Board regularly reviews its corporate governance
structure and practices to ensure that the same reflects
the regulatory changes, best practice and stakeholder's
expectation.

The Board of Directors
The Board is collectively responsible for the overall strategic
direction of the Group with oversight and review of the
management, administration and overall governance. The
Board provides leadership necessary for the Group to

meet its business objectives within a robust framework of
internal controls. The Board exercises its oversight role
by setting appropriate business strategy and overseeing
delivery against the set strategy. The composition of the
Board is stipulated in the Group's Articles of Association
which provides that the board shall comprise of a maximum
of twelve (12) directors.

The Board currently consists of nine (9) directors, one (1)
executive director and eight (8) non-executive directors
including the deputy chairman, of whom three (3) are
independent directors. The Corporate Governance &
Nomination Committee is responsible for recommending
directors for election by shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting (AGM). Nominated directors undergo
screening by the Corporate Governance and Nomination
Committee guided by the Board Appointment Guidelines duly
approved by the Board. All the directors' appointments
are subject to confirmation by shareholders at the AGM
except for the Group Chief Executive Officer. At every
AGM, at least one third of the non-executive directors
must retire from the Board and where eligible, stand for
re-election.

Board Operations
The Board has in place an annual work plan that sets out
the Board activities for the year. To adequately cover the
Board's annual work plan, board and committee meeting
dates are agreed on and circulated in December for the
preceding year. This enables the Board to have a detailed
review of the Group's operation and strategy, approve
business plans, budgets and financial statements. The
Board meets at leastfour (4) times a year and additionally
as may be necessary in response to business needs.

The Board Chairman, in conjunction with the Group
Chief Executive Officer and the Company Secretary,
sets the agenda for each meeting. The Board receives all
information relevant to the discharge of its obligations
in an accurate and timely manner enabling it to maintain
effective control over strategic, financial, operational and
compliance issues.

Board and Committee packs are circulated in advance
to give directors ample time to review the content and
request clarification before any meeting. This also
allows the directors to undertake an appropriate review

Board Skills and Diversity
The Board recognizes and embraces the benefits of diversity in bringing different perspective into Board meetings in
offering better anticipation of the risks that are inherent in the business and the opportunities that the Group pursues.
The Group seeks to have a Board that has a diverse mix of individuals with synergistic range of attributesskills, knowledge,
experience, professional and industry knowledge and expertise aligned to the needs of the business. The directors of the
Group come from broad industry and professional backgrounds, with varied experience and expertise aligned to the needs
of the business. The areas of expertise of the current Board are general management, finance, marketing, media, IT and legal.
The Board as presently constituted has the appropriate mix of skills, knowledge and experience to deal with current and
emerging issues and effectively guide management in attainment of its strategic objectives. Women constitute 20% of
our Board and the Corporate Governance & Nomination Committee has been tasked to take thisinto consideration in its
subsequent nominations. The Board is fully committed to enhancing its gender balance in the Board to increase women
representation in the Board. Short biographies of the Directors, including details of their relevant, skills, experience,
nationalities and other directorship, are set out in the Directors and Statutory Information and Directors Profile pages.
The Board appreciates the benefits of diversity in all of its forms (gender, age, ethnicity and welfare), within its own membership
and across the Company. Talent is our competitive advantage and diversity is a critical component ofour success, providing
better understanding, connectivity and insight to our consumers and our employees. The Board encourages initiatives
to improve gender diversity in management and this has resulted in the establishment of The Standard Group Women
Network which continues to articulate the voice of women within the organization and position them for leadership.

Executive Officer and Non-Executive Directors, the Chairman and Company Secretary, on an annual basis. The evaluation
in respect of the financial year 2023 was conducted internally by the Chairman through the coordination of the Company
Secretary. The evaluation was conducted by each Director completing a Board Evaluation Form which is designed to
obtain feedback on the Board's performance in key thematic areas. The Evaluation also seeks to identify development
opportunities and areas of improvement. Results were collated confidentially by the Company Secretary and reviewed
by the Chairman. The evaluation established that the Board understood its role and that the Board members have a good
understanding of the business and receive the information they need to inform decisions on a timely and accurate manner.

CHAIRMAN'S
STATEMENT

Dear Esteemed Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors and Management,
I am delighted to present to you the audited financial
statements for the Financial Year ended 31st December,
2023. This past year has been one of profound
transformation and resilience, marked by both external
challenges and internal evolution. It is against this
backdrop that I share with you our journey, the obstacles
we have navigated, and the strategic responses that have
positioned us for sustained growth.

Navigating Economic Challenges

The Kenyan economy in 2023 has faced significant
headwinds. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
growth was constrained by multiple factors,
including heightened inflation and volatile
forex trading conditions. Inflation rates have
soared, primarily driven by increased costs of
essential goods and services, impacting the
purchasing power of our consumers and
the operational costs for businesses like
ours.

The geopolitical landscape, notably
the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, has
further complicated our economic
environment. The war has disrupted
global supply chains, leading to
increased costs and scarcity of key
import products, including newsprint
and other production materials vital for our
operations. These disruptions have necessitated
strategic adjustments in our procurement
processes to mitigate the impact on our
production capabilities and cost structures.

"Together, we will
continue to navigate
the complexities of
our industry and drive
forward our vision for
sustainable growth
and excellence."

CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD

AND
Strategic Responses and Transformations

Internally, the group has undergone substantial
transformation to address the evolving challenges. We
have restructured several departments to enhance
agility and responsiveness. Our talent development
programs have been intensified, focusing on upskilling
our workforce to navigate our operational complexities
effectively. In response to these external pressures, the
group has embarked on several transformative initiatives
to strengthen our resilience and adaptability:
1. Operational Efficiency: We have implemented
rigorous cost management and operational
efficiency programs to offset rising costs and
ensure the sustainability of our operations.
Leveraging technology and process improvements
has been central to these efforts.
2. Digital Innovation: Our continued investment in
digital platforms has not only expanded our reach
but also diversified our revenue streams. This
strategic pivot towards digital media is crucial
in mitigating the impacts of traditional market
volatilities.
3. Supply Chain Adaptation: To counter the
disruptions in import products, we have
diversified our supplier base and explored
alternative materials and local sourcing options,
ensuring continuity in our production processes.

and leadership. Concurrently, we have welcomed new
members whose expertise and fresh perspectives are set
to drive our strategic vision forward. These appointments
underscore our commitment to robust governance and
strategic oversight.

Looking Ahead
As we move forward, we remain cautiously optimistic. The
external economic environment is expected to remain
challenging, but we are confident in our strategic direction
and the resilience of our operations. Our commitment to
innovation, operational excellence, and stakeholder value
remains steadfast.

In conclusion, I extend my heartfelt thanks to our
shareholders, board members, management team, and
employees for their unwavering support and dedication.
Your trust and commitment are the pillars of our success.
Together, we will continue to navigate the complexities of
our industry and drive forward our vision for sustainable
growth and excellence.

Thank you for your continued confidence in The Standard
Group PLC.

Sincerely,

Board Changes and Governance
This year has also seen significant changes within our
Board of Directors. We have bid farewell to several
esteemed members who resigned after years of dedicated
service. Their contributions have been invaluable, and
we extend our deepest gratitude for their commitment

AG. GROUP CEO'S
STATEMENT

Dear Shareholders,

As we present the Annual Financial Report for the year
ended December 2023, I would like to highlight briefly
on the state of the media industry in Kenya and our
achievements over the past year. Kenya's economic
situation in 2023 was characterized by high inflation,
deterioration of the Kenya Shilling, debt-related risks and
other uncertainties. The continued delay in settling pending
bills owed to the Media Companies by the Government
further adversely impacted the media sector. Challenges
arising out of fast-changing media consumption behaviors
and increased media fragmentation further compounded
the situation. However, despite this challenging operating
environment, our business has shown great resilience
driven by an unwavering commitment to serve our
audiences and stakeholders.

Our Product Portfolio
Our diverse portfolio continues to set us apart in the
media industry. In print media, Standard Newspaper
remains a cornerstone of quality journalism, with a robust
digital presence that extends our reach and influence
internationally. Our broadcast division continues to
thrive with an array of radio stations - Radio Maisha,
Spice FM, Vybez Radio, and Berur FM - each catering to
distinct audience preferences. In television, KTN News,
KTN Home, BTV, and KTN Farmers consistently deliver
top-tier content, making us leaders in both news and
entertainment.

Customer Focus and Market Dynamics
Our customers remain at the heart of everything we do.
We are deeply grateful for their loyalty and trust, which
inspire us to continually innovate and improve. Our
standing commitment is to continuously enhance our
value proposition and win market share through superior
service and engagement.

"Our customers
remain at the heart of
everything we do. We
are deeply grateful for
their loyalty and trust,
which inspire us to
continually innovate
and improve."

Operational Excellence and Cost Management
In response to the evolving market landscape, we have
undertaken various cost-cutting initiatives to streamline
operations and ensure sustainability. This included a staff
rationalization process. These measures were necessary
to optimize our resources and maintain financial health.
Our commitment to operational excellence is reflected
in the enhanced efficiency of our systems and processes,
positioning us well for future growth.

Transformation Process and Strategic Initiatives
Under the guidance of a Transformation Committee of the
Board, a transformation process was kicked off in 2023.
The transformation agenda was anchored on 4 main
pillars; Cash Generation, Positive Profit After-tax Position,
100% maintenance of the License to Operate and Balance
Sheet restructure.

The process entailed the development and implementation
of a bankable plan and saw the Company embark on
various projects and initiatives aimed at transforming the
business, enhancing our digital capabilities, improving
content delivery, increasing efficiency and fostering a
culture of continuous improvement.

Looking Ahead
As the media industry continues to evolve it is imperative
that we respond quickly and effectively. In line with this
we have developed a new strategy aimed at ensuring that
the business is fit for purpose, stays competitive and is
very well-positioned to take advantage of the emergent
opportunities in a digital- driven media environment.

Content is at the heart of all that we do, and we remain
dedicated to our mission of delivering high-quality content
and services to our audiences. Our extensive footprint,
coupled with a strategic focus on digital innovation,
positions us to navigate the future with confidence. We
stand committed to creating value for our shareholders,
providing exceptional experiences for our customers, and
fostering a dynamic and inclusive work
environment for our
employees.”

In closing, I would like to express my sincere gratitude
to our board of directors, management team, all the
employees, and partners for their unwavering support and
dedication. Together, let us continue to pursue excellence
and work towards achieving new heights of success..

Thank you.

STRATEGIC
OVERVIEW

Future Outlook

Deep uncertainty has characterized the global landscape
in recent years, and there is little prospect of a near-term
return to greater predictability. International conflicts,
growing social strains, technological shifts and tight
financial conditions have all contributed to heightened
volatility and continue to reshape patterns of economic
activity. This makes for a particularly challenging
environment for businesses and government to operate,
with this heightened complexity being a growing challenge
where businesses will adopt and develop corrective
measures to respond to low growth and an unpredictable
operating environment.

The media landscape continues to evolve rapidly, with
digital advertising becoming dominant as businesses
shift budgets from traditional media to online platforms.
Social media, influencer marketing, and programmatic
advertising are leading this charge. To succeed, brands
will need to pivot from insight to foresight and present
consumers with emotive and instinctive solutions that
will dictate not only whether they prefer a brand but also
if a brand even crosses their radar in an AI-filtered and
culturally reshaped reality. Brands need to begin laying the
foundation now to future-proof themselves, developing
and adopting the predictive capabilities and anticipatory
behaviors needed to differentiate and grow in this new
era.

Consumers expect ever more relevant content and
personalized experiences, and there is a significant shift
in content consumption, with video-on-demand and
streaming services gaining popularity. This and economic
uncertainty are reshaping advertising strategies and
leading to an increased focus on digital video content and
data-driven marketing strategies that deliver targeted
campaigns with better engagement and ROI.

As a Group, we are boldly re-inventing our
business to compete
robustly in the digital
age. Our Strategic
Plan is a critical first
step in shaping the
Group's future outlook
and direction.

As we execute our strategic plan, key imperatives that
will feature most prominently in our strategic goals
include: 1) Deeper focus on Innovation/R&D, 2) Revenue,
3) Improving internal efficiencies and regulatory compliance
4) Investing in human capital and promoting staff welfare to
unlock productivity growth and 5) Capital Allocation from
strategic investor financing which will be essential for our
sustainable growth in the evolving media landscape.

Navigating Challenges, Building
Resilience, and Embracing Growth

Amidst the whirlwind of changes in the media landscape,
The Standard Group PLC has not only weathered the
storms but has emerged as a beacon of resilience and
innovation. Despite facing formidable challenges,
including disruptions in traditional media and evolving
consumer habits, the company has demonstrated
remarkable adaptability and unwavering commitment to
delivering value to its consumers.

In the face of adversity, and the hostile business
environment, caused largely by the problem of pending
bills and a slowdown in the overall economy, we continue
to transform our business to best serve our customers. The
company has risen to the occasion, embracing innovation,
fostering impactful partnerships, and driving sustainable
growth. Our relentless pursuit of excellence has not only
sustained our operations but has also positioned us for
future success in an ever-evolving industry landscape.
As we reflect on the achievements of 2023, our priority
remains to serve our customers with the best media
products, improve the welfare of our staff, and fulfil our
obligations to all our stakeholders.

The evolution of the media landscape has been unrelenting
with rapid increase in the disruptions in radio, print and TV
and the advent and growing impact of digital platforms.
The context of this assertion is the need therefore to
adapt with the changing trends in the consumer habits,
to ensure that Standard Group brands deliver great value
to the consumers. Admittedly, we have had to adjust how
we do business to meet the consumer needs, as informed
by changing consumer demands.

Whereas the business
environment remained
challenging, as attributed to
many factors, practical yet
efficient approaches were
adopted to ensure the key
goal of recruiting and retaining
audiences across all the
Group's platforms is sustained.
Specific focus was on
execution of brand campaigns,
content marketing, consumer
engagement activities and
robust brand visibility on
integrated media platforms.

The activities were aligned
with the marketing strategy of
“audience first”.

KTN Home was rebranded and assumed the best
foundational colours for the entertainment industry,
which are purple and yellow. The new look is dynamic,
refreshing, aspirational and inspires hope, and is indeed
the home of entertainment. It remains a family channel, it's
fun, its captivating, inspirational and puts the audiences
first in its content offering on all platforms. The new look

The 9th edition of Pulse Music Video Awards was very
successful in recruiting youthful audiences for the
entertainment brands. The overall winner received 1M
worth of medical insurance and the event cemented the
position of Standard Group as the home of entertainment
for the youth.

The focus for Radio Maisha was promotion of new talents
who joined the station and through major brand events
such as Choma na Ngoma. Additionally, English Premier
League activations in clubs have sustained the momentum
for the brand by maintaining the brand relevance and
furthered the connections with the audiences. The Lokole
Festival graced by Rhumba maestro Ferre Gola and other
local artists, accorded Radio Maisha the energy that
propelled the brand to second place in the country in
2023, according to IPSOS data. Radio Maisha was voted
as the best radio station in the prestigious KUZA Awards,
held by Communication Authority of Kenya.

There was an intense promotion of the Group's brands
on billboards across the country. This was a significant
achievement that increased top of mind awareness of
brands, cultivated brand equity and the impact could be
felt in the growth of audiences.

Championing Safety at The Standard Group

At The Standard Group, our commitment to Occupational
Health and Safety (OSH) isn't just a priority; it's a way of
life. We embarked on a journey to not just meet industry
standards but to set new benchmarks in workplace safety,
recognizing the invaluable role it plays in the well-being of
our employees and the efficiency of our operations.

Safety Week Celebration: Every
year, we celebrate our muchanticipated Safety Week in April,
a vibrant extravaganza of safety
activities. From mastering first
aid techniques to honing fire
safety skills, from road safety
awareness to comprehensive
medical check-ups, every aspect
of safety was meticulously
covered.

Safety Training Initiatives: Throughout the year, we
invested in empowering our team with essential skills.
First aid training ensured that our staff were equipped
to handle emergencies confidently. Road safety training
aimed to instill responsible habits on the road, while
fire safety sessions and drills fortified our preparedness
for any unforeseen circumstances. Our OSH Committee
underwent specialized training, reinforcing our internal
network of safety advocates.

Fitness and Wellness: Understanding that physical fitness
and mental well-being are pillars of a productive workforce,
we prioritized access to a gym within the premises at the
Standard Group Centre, on Mombasa Road. Additionally,
we organized invigorating hikes, immersing ourselves in
the rejuvenating embrace of nature at Oloolua Nature Trail,
Karura Forest and Kijabe Trail among other adventures.

Our fitness enthusiasts didn't stop there. They
enthusiastically participated in renowned marathons and
walks, not just for the thrill of competition but to champion
health and wellness. From the Standard Chartered
Marathon to the Mater Heart Run, from the Lukenya
University Marathon to the Campus to Campus Run, our
team left footprints of commitment and resilience.

Mental Health Awareness: Recognizing the importance of
mental well-being, we embarked on a series of initiatives
to foster a supportive environment. From enlightening
webinars to dynamic dance collaborations with Dance
Klan, we celebrated World Mental Health Awareness Day
with vigor. We
also introduced
Men's
Hub,
providing a safe
space for men to
connect, share,
and support each
other through
life's challenges.

Industry Collaboration: In
collaboration with The
Workplace Safety Professionals
Association of Kenya (WSPAK),
we hosted the inaugural
Conference themed "Capacity
Building in the Occupational
Safety & Health Profession."
This milestone event brought
together industry leaders to
exchange insights and advance
the cause of workplace safety.

Community Engagement: Our commitment to safety extended beyond our walls.
Preceding the World Day of Safety, we convened at Karura Forest for a day of impactful
activities. From a spirited first aid competition to empowering mental health talks,
from exhilarating team-building exercises to nurturing our environment through tree
planting, every moment was a testament to our dedication to safety and community
stewardship.

aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group's and Company's
auditor is aware of that information.
6. Terms of appointment of auditors
Grant Thornton LLP have been appointed and are willing to continue in office in accordance with
the Company's Articles of Association and Section 723 of the Kenyan Companies Act, 2015.
The directors monitor the effectiveness, objectivity and independence of the auditor. This

behalf of the shareholders.
7. Business overview
Summary of results
The Group operates on various platforms which include:
(a) Print platform. This platform has two main publications; The Standard and The Nairobian.
Revenue from this platform is generated from the sale of newspaper copies and
advertisements on the publications.
(b) Broadcast platform. This includes television and radio platforms.
i. The television platform comprises 4 television stations which include; KTN-Home,
KTN-News, Btv and KTN Farmers TV. KTN Home is a station providing all round
entertainment and news for general audiences. KTN-News is the first 24 hour news
channel in East Africa. Btv is a station catering for the sports and entertainment
needs of the youth. KTN Farmers TV was rolled out as part of the Group's Farm
Kenya Initiative; and aims to connect all stakeholders in the agribusiness sector.
Revenue from the television platforms is generated through advertisements on the
television stations.
ii. The radio platform comprises 4 radio stations which are Radio Maisha, Spice FM,
Vybez Radio and Berur FM. Revenue from the radio platforms is generated through
advertisements on the radio stations.
(c) Digital platform. Digital platforms include the Standard Digital website, Value Added
Services (VAS), Digger Classifieds and social media pages. Revenue is generated through
advertisements ran on these platforms, subscriptions to access content on these platforms and
sale of digital copies of the newspaper.
The Group revenue decreased by 13% to KES 2.3 billion from KES 2.7 billion in the prior year.
The decline was a result of decreased revenue from advertising clients. Owing to the tough
economic conditions, companies reduced their marketing spends to avail funds for other critical
expenses, to keep businesses afloat. Further, there was experience of decline in audience
engagement which was a factor of revenue decline. Government institutions minimised their
marketing activities and that negatively impacted the Group's revenues.

Group direct costs slightly increased compared to 2022 largely due to changes in newsprint prices
and electricity costs. Group overhead costs closed at 25% lower than 2022 largely from staff cost
reduction measures and variation of fuel prices.
The Group incurred a loss before tax of KES 723 million compared to a loss before tax of KES
1 billion in 2022. This was driven by the factors mentioned above on revenue and overhead costs.

Principal risk:

The principal risk facing the business were high level of inflation, audience engagement and rising
cost of doing business. Increased inflation, from rising cost of food, electricity, and fuel, increased
the cost of doing business. Being a post electioneering year, the speed of recovery from the loss
of income from the slowed economic activities was a risk as there were uncertainties on the
policies that came with the new government. We are positive with the economic stabilisation after
the close of elections and resumption of business activities, clients will recommence their
advertising spends to grow our revenues. Further, with the new government institutions having
settled in, there is renewed optimism of growth in advertising spends and consequently our
revenues.

The financial statements were approved and authorised for issue at a meeting of the Board of
Directors held on 29th June 2024.

Remuneration Policy

The Group has an approved Remuneration Policy for the Board which defines the remuneration and
related privileges received by the director of the Company. The policy seeks to recognize the
contribution the directors make to the success of the Group while reflecting the value of the roles they
play, as well as the level to which they perform them. Our approach to recognizing our director's
contribution to the business is based on the following principles:

— Competitive remuneration - The remuneration is sufficient to attract and retain highly experienced
directors to effectively direct the affairs of the Group.
— Affordability and sustainability - Our remuneration is sustainable and affordable in the face of the
Group's performance in the industry.
— Equitable - The reward is equitable and commensurate to the amount of time and skill in delivering
the Group's strategic objectives.

The Nominations Committee of the Board is responsible for setting and administering the directors
Remuneration Policy. The Nominations Committee continuously reviews the entitlements under the
policy to ensure these are aligned to the market.

THE STANDARD GROUP PLC 51

=== PAGE BREAK ===

=== PAGE 60 ===
Remuneration structure for Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Executive Director is based on the terms of engagement negotiated
and outlined in the contract of employment. The Group's Policy is to appoint the Executive
Director for an initial four-year period, which may be extended for a further term by mutual
consent. The initial appointments and any subsequent reappointments are subject to annual
performance review by the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee.

Remuneration structure for Executive Directors (continued)
The salary for the Executive Director is set at a level which is considered appropriate to attract an
individual with the necessary skills, experience and ability to oversee the business. Judgement is used
but consideration is given to a number of internal and external factors including responsibilities, market
positioning, inflation and The Standard Group PLC reward policies. The salary is subject to annual
reviews upon attainment of specific objectives.

Other benefits provided include: medical cover, gratuity and club membership which are payable as per
The Standard Group PLC reward policies in force from time to time. Travel and other reasonable
expenses incurred in the course of performing duty are paid as per the Group's travel and subsistence
Policies. These ensure the package is competitive.

Remuneration structure for Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board upon recommendation
by the Nomination Committee in line with the Remuneration Policy. In determining the remuneration
for Non-Executive Directors, the Board considers the nature and extent of their contribution and
responsibilities. In addition, Director's remuneration is subject to regular reviews and external
benchmarking to ensure that we continually offer a competitive package commensurate with the
remuneration for other Non-Executive Directors in the same industry.

Non-Executive Directors receive honoraria fees in recognition of the services rendered to the Group,
which is payable quarterly in arrears. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors are paid an attendance
fee in recognition of the time spent attending Board and Committee meetings.

The Group also provides for travel and accommodation costs incurred by the Non-Executive Directors
in connection with the Group's business in line with the Group's travel and subsistence policies in force
from time to time.

Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any performance related pay or pension. These Directors
do not have service contracts and their appointment, reappointment and retirement is subject to terms
of the Group's Articles of Association.

Changes to Directors' remuneration
During the year 3 Non executive directors forewent full fees and sitting allowances. (2022: 100%
forfeiture for all except for Robin Sewell who resigned).

Directors' Shareholding
Directors can purchase or sell shares of the Company in the open market subject to the regulations of
the Kenyan Companies Act, 2015. During the year under review, none of the Directors held shares in
the Company.

THE STANDARD GROUP PLC
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES

The Companies Act, 2015 requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year
that give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and Company as at the end of the
financial year and of their profit or loss for that year. It also requires the directors to ensure that the
Company keeps proper accounting records that:
(a) show and explain the transactions of the Group and Company;
(b) disclose, with reasonable accuracy, the financial position of the Group and Company; and
(c) enable the directors to ensure that every financial statement required to be prepared complies
with the requirements of the Companies Act, 2015.

The directors accept responsibility for the preparation and presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and in the manner required by the Kenya
Companies Act, 2015. They also accept responsibility for:

i. designing, implementing and maintaining internal control as they determine necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or
error;
ii. selecting suitable accounting policies and then applying them consistently; and
iii. making judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

The Directors have assessed the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and highlighted their
assessment in note 2(e) of the financial statements.

The directors acknowledge that the independent audit of the financial statements does not relieve them
of their responsibility.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE STANDARD GROUP PLC
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Opinion

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of The Standard Group Plc (the "Company") and
its subsidiaries (together, the "Group") set out on pages 18 to 82, which comprise the consolidated
statement of financial position at 31 December 2023 and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and
other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of
cash flows for the year then ended, together with the Company statement of financial position at 31
December 2023, and the Company statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes
in equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the notes to the financial statements, including a
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the consolidated and separate annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the
financial position of The Standard Group Plc and its subsidiaries as at December 31, 2023, and of their
financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Kenyan Companies Act, 2015.

Basis of Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report.

We are independent of the company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for
Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) together with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Kenya, and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our
audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our
audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a
separate opinion on these matters.

We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our
report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE STANDARD GROUP PLC
(continued)

Key Audit Matters (continued)

Credit risk and estimation of expected credit
losses on financial assets
The Group is exposed to credit risk arising, mainly,
from credit sales of goods and services to customers
and investment in subsidiaries.

The recognition of credit loss allowances on financial
assets, as required by IFRS 9, involves the use of
significant judgements and estimates by
management.

Management apply significant judgements and
estimates in the following areas as described in note
6 of the financial statements:
• The determination and application of IFRS 9 risk
parameters i.e. probability of default (PD), and
loss given default (LGD) on trade receivables;
and
• The definition of default and determination of
probability of default.
• Determination of expected timing for settlement
of government trading debt.

The disclosures on the application of IFRS 9 in the
determination of expected credit losses is in notes 3(1)
and 5(b) of the financial statements.

Adequacy and completeness of the libel
provision

The Group is subject to civil claims arising from
content in the electronic and print media, broadcasts
and publications. There is uncertainty as to how
claims will be resolved and therefore significant
judgement is required in assessing the likely outcome
and the potential liability for such matters.

The Directors apply significant judgement when
considering whether, and how much, to provide for
the potential exposure of each litigation.

The disclosures on the determination of expected
provisions and contingent liabilities are in note 34 of
the financial statements.

How our audit addressed the Key Audit
Matter
We evaluated the Group's accounting
policies for compliance with the principles of
IFRS 9.

We assessed and tested the key modelling
assumptions for reasonableness, including
the expected timing of the settlement of
receivables from the government and other
financial assets.

We validated the key inputs into the expected
credit loss model against source documents/
reports and checked for mathematical
accuracy of the model.

We evaluated the adequacy of disclosures in
the financial statements in accordance with
the requirements of the International
Financial Reporting Standards.

How our audit addressed the Key Audit
Matter
We obtained and reviewed documents
relating to significant legal cases filed against
the Group to develop an independent
assessment of the potential exposure and
compared this against provisions made,
including holding discussions with Group's in
house legal counsel to understand the nature
of ongoing claims, and to assess the latest
status.

We obtained the relevant historical
information and recent judgments made by
the courts of law alongside confirmations
from external lawyers to challenge the basis
used for the provisions recorded as well as
the completeness of the cases provided for
by management; and

We evaluated the adequacy of disclosures in
the financial statements in accordance with
the requirements of the International
Financial Reporting Standards.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE STANDARD GROUP PLC
(continued)

Other Matter

The consolidated and separate financial statements of the Group and company for the year ended 31
December 2022 were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those
statements on 28 April 2023.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial
statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our
opinion on the consolidated and separate financial statements does not cover the other information and,
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements, our responsibility is to
read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information, we
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements

The directors are responsible for the preparation of consolidated and separate financial statements that
give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the
requirements of the Kenyan Companies Act 2015, and for such internal control as the directors determine
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and group using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or company
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the group's financial reporting process.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE STANDARD GROUP PLC
(continued)

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

* Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

* Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the group's and company internal control.

* Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.

* Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's or company ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our
auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the
date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to
continue as a going concern.

* Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in
a manner that achieves fair presentation.

* Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the group to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit.

THE STANDARD GROUP PLC
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

1. REPORTING ENTITY

The Standard Group PLC (“the Company”) is a limited liability Company incorporated in Kenya
under the Kenya Companies Act, 2015 and is domiciled in Kenya. The financial statements

The address of its registered office and principal place of business is as follows:

The Standard Group Centre
Mombasa Road
PO Box 30080 – 00100
Nairobi.

2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

(a) Statement of compliance

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations
Committee (IFRS IC) applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial
statements comply with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB). Changes in significant accounting policies are detailed in Note 4. Details of the
Group and Company significant accounting policies are included in Note 3.

For the Companies Act, 2015 reporting purposes in these financial statements, the balance
sheet is represented by the statement of financial position and profit and loss account is
represented by the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

(b) Basis of measurement

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except where stated
otherwise.

(c) Functional and presentation currency

These Financial Statements are presented in Kenya shillings (KES 000), which is the
Company’s functional currency. All financial information presented has been rounded to
the nearest thousand (KES 000) except where otherwise indicated.

(d) Use of estimates and judgements

In preparing these financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.

......................................................................................................................................................................... THE STANDARD GROUP PLC 69

=== PAGE BREAK ===

=== PAGE 78 ===
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to
estimates are recognised prospectively.

In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical
judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount
recognised in the financial statements are described in note 6.

(e) Going concern

The Group and Company in the current year incurred a loss after tax of KES 1.261 Billion
(2022: KES 865 million) and KES 1.067 Billion (2022: 775 million) respectively during the
year ended 31 December 2023 and, as of that date, the Group's and Company's current
liabilities exceeded the current assets by KES 2.1 billion (2022: KES 2.3 billion) and KES 2.1
billion (2022: KES 2.3 billion) respectively. As at year end the Group had total negative equity
of KES 433 million (2022: positive KES 139 million) whilst the Company had a negative equity
of KES 648 million (2022: negative equity KES 165 million).

The current liquidity constraints in the economy have caused The Group to struggle to collect
from its current debtors thus impacting the liquidity of the Company. Due to financial
constraints the group has been unable to settle some amounts due to key suppliers, statutory
bodies, and employee related costs. Management does not foresee any new sources of
uncertainty that will impact the business in a materially negative way. The business still enjoys
immense goodwill and confidence and this demonstrated by the market share it commands
across its product offering.

The directors remain confident that the Group and Company will remain a going concern over
the next 12 months. In making this assessment, the directors have considered in detail all
pertinent facts as outlined below:

a. A thorough review of the budgetary and forecasting process to ensure that appropriate
assumptions have been considered in developing the Group's forecast. The key areas of
focus will include:

i. Review of the revenue strategy to ensure that the investments in the broadcast and
digital platforms continue to grow in revenue generation. This will drive the revenue
up by about 35% in 2024 with a projected growth there on.
ii. Cost containment measures to ensure that the operations are run efficiently which
include full utilization of all editorial staff; travel expenses, rental expenses and
aggressive collection measures to reduce the utilization of the financing facilities thus
lower finance cost.
iii. Continuous engagement with creditors to agree on payment plans based on paying
ability of the company and in line with projected cash flows.
iv. The Group expects to start generating positive operating cashflows in 2024 thus able
to meet its current and future obligations including payment of its statutory
deductions.

b. The Group's board and management have implemented initiatives that are geared towards
improving the cash collection cycle that include but are not limited to:

select clients to forward pay for services rendered.
ii. Ensure continuous engagement with government officers to enhance debt
collections.
iii. Engage various debt collection agencies to fast-track debt collection.
iv. Continuous engagement with creditors to ensure continued service delivery
and increased number of credit days.
v. Organizational right sizing and staff rationalization as part of cost cutting
measures.
c. The Group has been heavily reliant on borrowing to fund expansion and capital
investments. To ensure that investments have been maintained even as performance
is expected to improve the shareholders have extended a loan in the first quarter of
2023. Further the NCBA facility was restructured in the first quarter. Subsequent to
the year end the Group still has enough unutilized borrowing facilities and is thus
able to meet its working capital requirements. The Shareholders have committed
continued support if need be.
d. The largest impact on revenue has been caused by changes in government policies
and regulations. The Group is thus focusing on investing and diversifying in
Broadcast (TV and Radio) and digital as these platforms are impacted much less than
the print platform of The Group.
e. Subsequent to the year end the Q1 2024 results of the group have seen positive growth
and improved performance compared to prior year with a positive EBITDA of KES
1.1 million and KES 32 million for the months of February and March. With April &
May also reporting positive EBITDAs of KES 8.2 million and KES 1.7 million
respectively.
The Directors have reviewed the projections based on the above strategies and the medium-term plan.
Based on the implementation of the various turnaround initiatives outlined above, the directors
consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis. The
shareholders also indicated their willingness to support the business which is demonstrated by the
willingness of the majority shareholders to inject funds into the business as and when the need arises
as evidenced by the KES 392 million given in the current year. The group is also at an advanced stage
to secure another KES 300 million to ease the cashflow constraints as we gear up for further capital.
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in
these financial statements and have been applied consistently by Group entities.
(a) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement in the investee and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The financial statements of
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control
commences until the date that control ceases.
THE STANDARD GROUP PLC 71

=== PAGE BREAK ===

=== PAGE 80 ===
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group
companies are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised losses
are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset
transferred.
The holding Company accounts for dividends from subsidiary companies only when the right to
receive the dividends is established.

Non-controlling interests:
The Group recognises non-controlling interests at the non-controlling interest's proportionate
share of the acquired entity's net identifiable assets.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes
in equity and statement of financial position respectively.

Equity method
Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and
adjusted thereafter to recognise the group's share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the
investee in profit or loss, and the group's share of movements in other comprehensive income
of the investee. Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are
recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. The group recognises non-
controlling interests at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquired entity's
net identifiable assets.

Where the group's share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its
interest in the entity, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the group does not
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the
other entity.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its associates and joint ventures are
eliminated to the extent of the group's interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are also
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of equity-accounted investees have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Joint operations
The Group recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint
operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.

Separate financial statements
In the separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less
impairment and investment in associates is accounted for using the equity method. Cost is
adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments.
Cost also includes direct attributable costs of investment.

Business combinations

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations,
regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration
transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the:

* Fair values of the assets transferred
* Liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business
* Equity interests issued by the Group
* Fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration agreement; and
* Fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business
combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition
date. The group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-
by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of
the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

The excess of the:
i. consideration transferred,
ii. amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and
iii. acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity over the
fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts
are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the
difference is recognised directly in profit or loss as a bargain purchase.

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future
are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the
entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be
obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.

Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified
as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value, with changes in fair value
recognised in profit or loss.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the
acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the
acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognised in profit
or loss.

b) Revenue and other income recognition
Revenue comprises of income from print and broadcasting segments. The Group derives
revenue from the transfer of goods and services at a point in time in the following major
product lines: circulation and advertising. Revenue from print arises from the sale of
newspapers and magazines. The Group uses vendors and agents in the sale of newspapers and
magazines. The Group has been assessed as the principal in this arrangement, and therefore
recognises revenue on the gross amount. E-paper revenue is recognized on delivery of
electronic version of the newspaper to the customer. Advertising income is earned from both
print and broadcasting. Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group
expects to be entitled in a contract with a customer.

Revenue from the sale of newspapers and magazines is recognised upon the delivery of goods
to customers or when title has passed to customers. Advertising revenue is recognised when
advertisements are published in the newspaper or aired on television or radio. Revenue is
measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of VAT and
discounts. There are no significant estimates made in revenue recognition.

Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss using the effective interest method,
unless its collectability is in doubt.

Other income is recognised once control of the goods or service is passed to the customers and
largely includes sale of newspaper returns, production waste, broadcast content and courier
services.

c) Income tax

Income tax expense in profit or loss for the year comprises current income tax and the change
in deferred tax.

Current income tax is provided on the basis of the results for the year, as shown in the financial
statements, adjusted in accordance with tax legislation.

Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Currently
enacted tax rates are used to determine deferred income tax.

The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner
in which the company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the
carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax is recognised for unused tax losses and deductible temporary differences to the
extent that is probable that future profits will be available against which the tax asset can be
utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent
that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. Deferred tax is
calculated on the basis of the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date
and expected to apply when the asset is recovered, or the liability is settled.

d) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the financial statements when the Group has a legal or constructive
obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the
liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.

e) Segmental reporting
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about
components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in
order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. The Group's chief
decision maker is the chief executive officer. The Group organizes its activity by business lines
and these are defined as the Group's reportable segments. The business segments are Print and
Broadcast.

f) Property, plant and equipment

(i) Recognition and measurement
Initial recognition of items of property, plant and equipment is at cost and are consequently
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.

Properties in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes
are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and,
for qualifying assets, capitalised borrowing costs.

Such properties are classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment
when completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis
as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

(ii) Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing a component of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the
carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied
within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of
day-to-day servicing of property and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as
incurred.

THE STANDARD GROUP PLC 75

=== PAGE BREAK ===

=== PAGE 84 ===
(iii) Depreciation
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated to write off the cost in equal
annual instalments over their expected useful lives. The annual rates used are:

Buildings 2%
Plant and machinery 12.5%
Motor vehicles 25%
Furniture, fittings and equipment 10% - 33%

The depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting
date and adjusted if appropriate.

(iv) Disposal of property, plant and equipment
Gains and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment (calculated as the
difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item)
is recognised in profit or loss.

g) Intangible assets
(i) Software
Computer software and other intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses. The costs are amortised over the expected useful
lives of the software on the straight line basis. The annual rates used for amortisation are:

Computer software 20%

Amortisation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date
and adjusted if appropriate.

(ii) Trademark and broadcasting frequencies
Trademarks and frequency are initially recognised at cost. At each reporting date, the
Group reviews the carrying amount of the trademarks and broadcasting frequency to
determine whether there is any indication that these assets have suffered an impairment
loss. Such indicators include decline in market value or negative changes in technology,
markets, economy or laws. The trademarks and broadcasting frequency have indefinite
useful lives and are tested for impairment at each reporting date.

h) Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets and deferred tax assets are reviewed
at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such
indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.

76 STANDARD
GROUP
Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023

=== PAGE BREAK ===

=== PAGE 85 ===
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit
exceeds its recoverable amount. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group
that generates cash flows that are largely independent from other assets and groups. Impairment
losses are recognised in the profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-
generating units reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a
pro rata basis.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and
its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or
amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

i) Leases

As a lessee

At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group
and Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis
of its relative stand-alone prices.

The Group and Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease
commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the
initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the
commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle
and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is
located, less any lease incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the
commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the
underlying asset to the Group and Company by the end of the lease term or the cost of the
right-of-use asset reflects that the Group and Company will exercise a purchase option.

In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset,
which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the
right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain
remeasurements of the lease liability.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not
paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if
that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group and Company’s incremental borrowing rate.
Generally, the Group and Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

......................................................................................................................................... THE STANDARD GROUP PLC 77


=== PAGE BREAK ===

=== PAGE 86 ===
The Group and Company determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates
from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of
the lease and type of the asset leased. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease
liability comprise the following:

– fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
– variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the
index or rate as at the commencement date;
– amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
– the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group and Company is reasonably
certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group and
Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early
termination of a lease unless the Group and Company is reasonably certain not to
terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is
remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index
or rate, if there is a change in the Group and Company's estimate of the amount expected to be
payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group and Company changes its assessment of
whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised
in-substance fixed lease payment. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a
corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is
recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to
zero.

The Group and Company has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities
for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases. The Group and Company recognise the
lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease
term.

The Group and Company classifies leases that transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards
of ownership as finance leases. When this is the case, the leased assets are measured initially
at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease
payments. Minimum lease payments are the payments over the lease term that the lessee is
required to make, excluding any contingent rent. Subsequent to initial recognition, the assets
are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.

(j) Inventories

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct
materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and the overheads incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Costs of direct materials and general
consumable stores are determined on the weighted average cost basis. Net realisable value
represents the estimated selling price less the estimated cost to completion and costs to be
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Programmes are expensed when aired.

(k) Foreign currency translations

In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other
than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-
monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated
at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Gains and
losses on exchange are dealt with in the profit or loss.

(I) Financial instruments

(i) Recognition and initial measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s statement of financial
position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs
that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial
liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or
loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial asset or liability.

Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

(ii) Classification and subsequent measurement

Financial assets

The Group and Company classify their financial assets at amortised cost. The classification
depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management
determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

The classification of financial assets and their subsequent accounting will be determined by
the application of dual tests examining the contractual cash flow characteristics of the
financial instruments and the Group’s business model for managing the assets.

Financial assets may be held at amortised cost only where both:

(a) the asset is held in a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order
to collect contractual cash flows; and
(b) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows
that consist solely of principal and interest on the outstanding principal.

Financial assets – Business model assessment

The classification of financial assets depends on the entity’s business model for managing
the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. In determining the business
model, the information considered includes:

THE STANDARD GROUP PLC 79

=== PAGE BREAK ===

=== PAGE 88 ===
- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies
in practice. These include whether management's strategy focuses on earning
contractual interest income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the
duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected
cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's
management;
- the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held
within that business model) and how those risks are managed;
- how managers of the business are compensated – e.g. whether compensation is based
on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and
- the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons
for such sales and expectations about future sales activity.
Transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for
derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Group's
continuing recognition of the assets.
Financial assets – Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of
principal and interest
For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial
asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money
and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular
period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and
administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest,
the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether
the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of
contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment,
the Group considers:
- contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;
- terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable-rate features;
- prepayment and extension features; and
- terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse
features).
A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest
criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal
and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable
compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset
acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual paramount, a feature that permits or
requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount
plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable
compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair
value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.

=== PAGE 89 ===
Financial assets – Subsequent measurement and gains and losses
Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign
exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or
loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.

Financial liabilities – Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost. Other financial liabilities
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest
expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain
or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.

(iii) Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of
financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts
and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.

(iv) Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected on investments in debt instruments that
are measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI, trade receivables and contract assets, as well
as on financial guarantee contracts. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each
reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective
financial instrument.

The “incurred loss” model was replaced by the “expected credit loss” model in IFRS 9. This
applies to all financial assets not held at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPU) – certain
investments, trade receivables and other receivables.

For financial assets carried at amortised cost (including receivables such as trade debtors),
impairment losses should be recognised under the “expected loss model”, building up a
debtors’ provision / allowance account against credit losses over the life of the financial
asset (including an estimate of initial credit risk).

Under the impairment approach in IFRS 9 it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have
occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead, the Group will account for expected
credit losses, and changes in those expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit
losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial
recognition and, consequently, more timely information is provided about expected credit
losses.

The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of an asset and
whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout
each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the
company compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at the reporting date with
the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition.

THE STANDARD GROUP PLC 81

=== PAGE BREAK ===

=== PAGE 90 ===
(v) De-recognition

Financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from
the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a
transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial
asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the
risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial assets.

Financial liabilities

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged
or cancelled, or expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are
modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case
a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount
extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or
liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.

(vi) Write-off

Financial assets are written off either partially or in their entirety only when the Group has
stopped pursuing the recovery. If the amount to be written off is greater than the accumulated
loss allowance, the difference is first treated as an addition to the allowance that is then
applied against the gross carrying amount. Any subsequent recoveries are credited to credit
loss expenses.

(m) Employee benefits

(i) Defined contribution plan

The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for its permanent and
pensionable employees. The assets of the scheme are held in separate trustee administered
fund, which is funded by contributions from both the Group companies and employees.
The Group and all its employees also contribute to the National Social Security Fund, which
is a defined contribution scheme. The Group's contributions to the defined contribution
schemes are recognised in the profit or loss in the period which related services are rendered
by employees. The Group has no further obligation once the contributions have been paid.

(ii) Staff gratuity

The Group also has a gratuity plan for senior management staff. The Group's net obligation
in respect of the gratuity plan is calculated at a agreed rate of the salary of the employees
under the plan. The provision for liability recognised in the financial statements is the
estimated entitlement as a result of services rendered by employees up to the financial
reporting date. The Group recognises all expenses related to the gratuity plan in employee
costs in profit or loss.

(iii) Short term employee benefits

Short term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is
recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the
obligation can be estimated reliably.

(n) Cash and cash equivalents

For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include short term
liquid investments which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which were
within three months to maturity when acquired less advances from banks repayable within three
months from date of disbursement or confirmation of the advance.

(o) Related party transactions

The Group discloses the nature, volume and amounts outstanding at the end of each financial
year from transactions with related parties, which include transactions with the directors,
executive officers and Group or related companies.

(p) Earnings per share

The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of
the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders
and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive
potential ordinary shares.

(q) Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as ‘share capital’ in equity. Equity instruments issued by a Group
entity are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Incremental costs
directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares, net of any tax effects, are recognised as a
reduction from equity.

(r) Finance income and finance costs

Interest expense on borrowings is recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest rate
unless they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying
asset, in which case they are capitalized to that asset.

Foreign exchange gains and losses on financial assets and financial liabilities are reported on a
net basis as either finance income or finance cost depending on whether foreign currency
movements are in a net gain or net loss position.

(s) Leasehold land

The leasehold land relates to the land where the Standard Group Centre is located. Payments to
acquire leasehold interest in land are amortised over the period of the lease.

5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and
liquidity risk, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and capital risk. The Group's overall
risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to
minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance.

Risk management is carried out by the Finance department under policies approved by the Board of
Directors. The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written
policies covering specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of
derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and investing excess liquidity.

(a) Market risk

i. Foreign exchange risk

The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures,
primarily with respect to the US dollar, Euro, and GBP. Foreign exchange risk arises from
the purchase of materials and inputs in foreign currency. These include programs, newsprint
and items of property plant and equipment. Foreign denominated revenue is insignificant.

The Group mitigates this risk through cashflow planning where payments of purchased
denominated in foreign currency are scheduled at strategic points in the year, and also made
in bulk so as to increase the bargaining power of the Group when negotiating for foreign
exchange rates.

The carrying amounts of the Group's foreign currency denominated monetary assets and
liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:

Group and Company USD EURO GBP Total
2023: KES 000 KES 000 KES 000 KES 000

Financial assets
Cash at bank (3,708) 2,027 6,006 4,325
Foreign debtors 23,745 - - 23,745

Financial liabilities
Trade payables (281,568) (37,126) (9,266) (327,960)
Net foreign
currency liability (261,531) (35,099) (3,260) (299,890)

2022:

Financial assets
Cash at bank 3,700 584 281 4,565
Foreign debtors 25,718 4,783 - 30,502

Financial liabilities
Trade payables (209,912) (42,489) (9,860) (262,261)

Net foreign
currency liability (180,493) (37,122) (9,579) (227,194)

At 31 December 2023, if the Shilling had weakened/strengthened by 1% against the foreign
currencies with all other variables held constant, the impact on profit before taxation for the
year would have been KES 2,998,905 (2022: KES 2,271,943).

The following significant exchange rates have been applied during the year:

 Average
 2023 2022

USD 138.6 117.5
EURO 149.8 124.1
GBP 172.2 145.9

ii. Price risk

The Group does not hold financial instruments that would be subject to price risk.

iii. Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk

The Group has borrowings in the form of overdraft facilities and 5 year term loans with two
banks namely NCBA Bank Kenya PLC and Stanbic Bank Kenya Limited with a combined
overdraft limit of KES 105 million (2022: KES 185 million) at rates determined by prevailing
market conditions.

As at 31 December 2023, an increase/decrease of 1% on average borrowing rates would have
resulted in an increase/decrease in profit before taxation for Group by KES 2,998,905 (2022:
KES 8,499,000).

(b) Credit risk

Credit risk is managed on a Group-wide basis. Credit risk arises from trade receivables, cash at
bank and other receivables. The credit committee assesses the credit quality of each customer,
taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. Individual risk limits
are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the board. The
utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.

Expected credit loss (ECL) assessment as at 1 January and 31 December 2023

The Group uses a provision matrix to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from customers.
The loss rates are calculated using a ‘roll rate’ method based on the probability of a receivable
progressing through successive stages of delinquency to write-off. The provision matrix is
based on an entity’s historical default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and
is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. Roll rates are calculated separately for exposures in
different segments. The Group uses historical patterns to determine the future payment patterns
for government advertising debt. The expected future payments are then discounted to take into
account the time value of money.

The following table provides information about the maximum exposure to credit risk and ECLs
for trade receivables as at 31 December 2023 and 2022.The amounts on the table represent the
maximum exposure to credit risk.

(ii) Cash and cash equivalents

The Group and Company held cash and cash equivalents of KES 43,092,000 and KES
26,037,600 respectively (2022: Group and Company - KES 45,222,000 and KES
45,222,000 respectively). These amounts represent the maximum exposure to credit risk
for cash and cash equivalent balances. The cash and cash equivalents are held with banks
and financial institution counterparties.

Impairment on cash and cash equivalents has been measured on a 12-month expected
credit loss basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures and the resulting
amounts are not material.

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during
the year was as follows:

The customers under the fully performing category are paying their debts as they
continue trading. The default rate is low.

The debt that is overdue is not impaired and continues to be paid. The credit control
department is actively following this debt. Further, for circulation, the debt is partially
covered by cumulative cash deposits by vendors and agents.

The debt that is impaired has been provided for based on the expected credit loss
assessment model. However, debt collectors as well as the legal department are
following up on the impaired debt.

Other financial instruments for which the Group and Company is exposed to credit risk
are as follows:

(e) Capital risk management
The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as
a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital
structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group
may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders or sell assets to reduce debt.

Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total
borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.

The constitution of capital managed by The Standard Group PLC is as shown below:

6. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF
ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY

In the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. These are dealt with below:

Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and residual values

The company tests annually whether the useful lives and residual values are appropriate and in
accordance with its accounting policy. Judgement is required in determining the useful lives of
property, plant and equipment. Useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment have
been determined based on previous experience and anticipated disposal values when the assets are
disposed. This estimate is based on projected product lifecycles for its assets. It could change
significantly as a result of technical innovations and competitor actions in response to severe industry
cycles. Management will increase the depreciation charge where useful lives are less than previously
estimated lives, or it will write-off or write-down technically obsolete or non-strategic assets that have
been abandoned or sold.

Impairment of assets

At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. Judgement is required in making
this determination. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash
generating unit to which the asset belongs. Critical estimates are made by management in assessment
of impairment for non-financial assets. Significant estimates relate to the determination of the
projected cash flows and the discount rate.

Contingent liabilities

As disclosed in Note 34 of these financial statements, the Group is exposed to various contingent
liabilities in the normal course of business including a number of legal cases. There is uncertainty as
to how present and future claims and other liabilities will be resolved and therefore significant
judgement is required in assessing the likely outcome and the potential liability for such matters.

Management in consultation with the legal advisers evaluate the status of these exposures on a regular
basis to assess the probability of the Group incurring related liabilities. Provisions are made in the
financial statements where, based on the Directors' evaluation, a present obligation has been
established and it is probable that a liability will crystallise.

Income tax

Judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes due to the complexity of
legislation. There are many transactions and calculations for which ultimate tax determination is
uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax
audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome
of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact
the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

Trade receivables

The Group uses a provision matrix to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from customers. The
loss rates are calculated using a 'roll rate' method based on the probability of a receivable progressing
through successive stages of delinquency to write-off. Roll rates are calculated separately for
exposures in different segments. A number of significant judgements and estimations are also
required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such as:

• The application of IFRS 9 risk parameters i.e. probably of default (PD), loss given at default (LGD)
and exposure at default (EAD) to trade receivables; and
• The definition of default, determination of probability of default matrix and identification of
exposures with significant deterioration in credit quality.

The Group uses historical patterns to determine the future payment patterns for government
advertising debt. The expected future payments are then discounted to take into account the time
value of money.

Lease term and discount rates determination on adoption of IFRS 16

Critical estimates are made by management in determining lease terms in lease contracts. Specifically,
in determining which leases will be extended and renewed on expiry of the non-cancellable lease
term. Estimates are also made on the discount rate.

19. RIGHT OF USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES

These assets and liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments,
discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. The weighted average lessee's
incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities during the year was 13%.

The Group leases offices and motor vehicles. The leases for motor vehicles run for 2 years. The
leases for offices typically run for a period ranging between 5 – 9 years. Information about leases
for which the Group is a lessee is presented below.

In order to identify whether the Group's contracts gave rise to a lease, the Group looked out for
the following:
— The lease is a contract.
— The parties to the contract are lessor and lessee.
— The lease contract specifies the period of contract.
— The lessee uses the assets.
— The lessee, in consideration, pays the lease rentals to the lessor.
— The lessor is the owner of the asset and is entitled to the benefit of depreciation and other
allied benefits e.g., Tax payable under the Income Tax Act.
— The lessee claims the rentals as expenses chargeable to his income.

The trademarks and broadcasting licences have been accounted for as intangible assets with
an indefinite useful life. Management estimate that the products will generate net cash
inflows for the group for an indefinite period, therefore carrying them at cost without
amortisation, but for which an impairment assessment is carried out on an annual basis.
The Group acquired the rights to distribute the Eve trademark on 17 April 2009. An
agreement was signed transferring full title and guaranteeing all rights, titles and interest in
the publication to the Group. The carrying value of these rights is KES 6,000,000. The
additional trademarks relate to Farmers TV.
The Group acquired licenses for radio frequencies through its subsidiary, Toads Media
Group Limited and additional frequencies acquired directly by the parent. The Group made
reference to the cash generating ability of Radio Maisha and projected consistent revenue
growth for the foreseeable future and assessed these as not impaired.
At the end of the year, the Group assessed the recoverable amounts of both its investments
in trademarks and the frequency for impairment. The Group used reference to their cash
generating ability and assessed the frequencies as not impaired. For trademarks, the
assumption made was that they will continue to accrue commercial benefits in the
foreseeable future.

Net deferred income tax asset (441,789) (142,160) (583,949)

The deferred income tax asset has not been recognised as the company is yet to record a taxable
profit therefore, the availability of future taxable profits to utilise the net asset is in doubt. The
net deferred income not recognised is attributable to the above.

in the operating environment.

(b) Gratuity
Senior management staff on a fixed term contract are entitled to gratuity payments from
the company at a rate of 15% for every year worked. The company contributes the monies
to a defined contribution plan.

The assumptions made are that all the employees will reach the end of the contract period
and that there will be no decrease in salaries paid over the duration of the contracts. Due
to the short term nature of the contracts the impact on discounting will be very limited.

Capital commitments mainly relate to acquisition of new equipment and expansion of radio
and television reach

34. CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
As at 31 December 2023, the Group has provided a total of KES 210,202,594 (2022;
KES'170,152,594) in respect of on-going litigation mainly relating to libel charges arising
in the normal course of business. This covers both the balance and the cost of professional
legal services. Legal opinions obtained from the Group's advocates show that no additional
liability will arise from contingent liabilities that have not been provided for.
As at 31 December 2023, the Group had contingent assets held in Joint Interest accounts
amounting to KES 49,218,922 (2022; KES 49,218,922) in respect of on-going litigation
mainly relating to libel cases that are pending hearing and determination after an appeal has
been raised by the group.
35. CORRECTION OF ERRORS.
During 2023 the Group discovered that the investment in joint operations had been
erroneously accounted for as a joint venture. Consequently, the non-current asset and equity
position had been overstated. The errors have been corrected by restating each of the affected
financial statement line items for prior periods. The following tables summarise the impacts
on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
